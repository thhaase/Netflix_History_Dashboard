# Netflix_History_Dashboard

## Description of the Project

I used the [linked project](https://github.com/thhaase/R_Netflix_history_script) to learn how to create a shiny dashboard. 

### Sharing the tool with friends

If you want to share a shinyproject online with friends who don't have R installed, you need access to a server where R is installed. I found [this website](https://appsilon.com/how-to-share-r-shiny-apps/
) the most useful to achieve this goal. For this project the free version of shinyapps.io is very useful.

### Interpretation of Example

The Plots reveal not only interesting but quite useful information about my netflix-viewing behaviour. For example the timelineplot suggests that I tend to bingewatch. Compared to my friends, long periods without activity are followed by single days with very high activity. 

The plot of the months shows that I watch Netflix almost only in August, September and October and that for about 3 years (see calendar heatmap). So I could save a lot of money if I subscribed to Netflix only in those 3 months and I wouldn't even really notice. 

I blame the heavy Netflix usage on a Monday on the following: I had no events on Monday for 2 semesters and a lot the rest of the week. On that day, however, all my friends are busy, which creates a situation that favors Netflix usage.
