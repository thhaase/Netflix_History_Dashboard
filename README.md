# Netflix_History_Dashboard

## Description of the Project

I used the [linked project](https://github.com/thhaase/R_Netflix_history_script) to learn how to create a shiny dashboard. 

### Sharing the tool with friends

If you want to share a shinyproject online with friends who don't have R installed, you need access to a server where R is installed. I found [this website](https://appsilon.com/how-to-share-r-shiny-apps/
) the most useful to achieve this goal. For this project the free version of shinyapps.io is very useful.
